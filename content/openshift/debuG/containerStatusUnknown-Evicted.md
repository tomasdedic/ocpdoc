Problem is that thanos compactor is allocating too much diskspace for compaction and since no PV is used, it is evicted by kubelet.
```sh
oc describe pod thanos-iocp4s-compactor-28186440-d6vqm|grep -A 2 Status
Status:         Failed
Reason:         Evicted
Message:        Pod The node had condition: [DiskPressure].
# strange message from events
The node was low on resource: ephemeral-storage. Container compactor was using 20Ki, which exceeds its request of 0.
```
